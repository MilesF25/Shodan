# Shodan
A program I made that summarizes the cybersecurity for a given city


## How it works

This program is designed to just summarize exposures in a city. All you have to do is enter a search query but Keep in mind that while it works
with out a city. Its intended to work with one. This is just a prototype of a deeper analysis tool.

There is a example of how to use the tool when you run it. This is the link the offical search query docs. https://www.shodan.io/search/examples
